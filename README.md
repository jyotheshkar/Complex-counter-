# Complex-counter-
built on Reactjs and CSS
Hey developers , i built my first project  on react and named it complex counter.
in this, increase is used to increase the number and decrease is used to decrease the number and reset is for reset the value to 0.
anothr button named "increase later" is mentioned , its domain is that it will increase the value in the counter by 100 ,in simple terms it 
will add up 100 to the current counter value and reset button will reset all.

NOTE : the CSS in this project was taken from john-smilga from coding addict channel ,as i was learning the course from his channel i built the logic of this project with REACT. moreover i customized :root in his CSS and modified my website.
thank you.....
